# TrybeWallet - Digital Wallet Simulation

Welcome to the TrybeWallet repository - a project developed at Trybe as part of the Full Stack Web Developer learning journey. This project simulates a digital wallet, allowing users to manage their expenses and track their balance.

## Main Features

- **Expense Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete expenses, keeping track of their spending.
- **Balance Tracking**: The application displays the user's current balance, taking into account all registered expenses.
- **Currency Conversion**: Expenses can be registered in different currencies, and the application automatically converts the values to the user's base currency using an exchange rate API.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management library used to manage the application's data.
- **RTL**: React Testing Library used for testing the application's components.

## Installation

Follow these steps to run TrybeWallet on your local environment:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrunoSouza88/JavaScript_TrybeWallet_Trybe.git
```
2. Access the project directory:

cd JavaScript_TrybeWallet_Trybe
```
3. Install dependencies:

5. Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000

## Usage

On the home page, use the form to add a new expense, selecting the currency, value, and description.

The registered expenses will be displayed in a table below the form, showing the converted value in the user's base currency.

The user's current balance is displayed at the top of the page, taking into account all registered expenses.

Expenses can be edited or deleted using the corresponding buttons in the table.
